# Android-Intents---FRP-bypass
Basic html site where all the links are all android intents. The idea was to create a captive portal with flipper zero to have FRP on the go. 

So far it hasn't worked how I would like but it does work. I'd recommend just connecting to your local network and running the index.html with the http server module in python.

There is 3 versions, Big ass listing of useful android intents down to a page with the single intent [this is for flipper zeros size restriction...]

I'm thinking this might work with a BLE spam but I haven't looked into it at all.

Good luck and if anyone gets intents to work in unusal ways please let me know.
